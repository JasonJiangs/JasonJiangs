## :computer: Interests
*	Deep Learning Methods for Molecular Interactions
*	Large Language Model for Life Sciences
*	Computational Genomics and Systems Biology

I am an incoming PhD student in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) program at USC. I received my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University and Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Wenzhou-Kean University. I mainly work on the intersection of machine learning and biology in a broad scope. I am interested in foundation models for life sciences and how to use them to interpret and discover new biology.
