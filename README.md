I am an incoming PhD student in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) program at USC. I am currently working as a visiting researcher at the Westlake University, Hangzhou, China. Previously I worked at Stanford, U Florida, U Virginia, and Alibaba Cloud. I am working on deep learning and GenAI for biology and drug discovery, and explore how to discover and interpret new biology using computational models.
